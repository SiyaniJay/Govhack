        <h1>Education, Employment, and Wellbeing in ACT</h1>
        <p>In the ACT, while Year 12 completion rates are high at 94%, only 57% of students go on to pursue tertiary education. This gap between finishing high school and advancing to higher education limits employment opportunities and contributes to higher unemployment and underemployment. Our goal is to bridge this gap by increasing access to tertiary education and skills training, improving job prospects and overall wellbeing in the community. This project explores the data behind this issue and proposes solutions to create better outcomes for students and the workforce.</p>
        <h2>Understanding the Impact of Education on Wellbeing</h2>
        <p>Education plays a critical role in shaping an individual's career and overall wellbeing. In the ACT, we observe a direct correlation between improved education levels and better employment outcomes. The trends show that as Year 12 completion and tertiary enrollment increase, unemployment rates decrease, and job satisfaction improves.</p>
        <p>By analyzing the data from 2010 to 2021, we can see that government initiatives and educational reforms have made a significant positive impact on the ACT community. This analysis highlights the following points:</p>

            <p>By 2025, Year 12 completion is projected to reach 98%, with tertiary enrollment increasing to 65%. Unemployment is expected to decrease further to 4.2%, while job satisfaction improves to 85%, ultimately enhancing wellbeing in the ACT.</p>
            <p>In this project, we utilized several key datasets to analyze the relationship between education, employment, and wellbeing in the ACT. The data provided valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by the community. Below are the datasets and reports referenced throughout the project:</p>
